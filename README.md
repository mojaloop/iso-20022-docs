# ISO 20022 Repository #

This repository is for material associated with the Mojaloop Foundation's project to align the ISO 20022 standard for financial messaging more closely with the objectives of the Level One Project

It is owned and maintained by MichaelJBRichards. If you have any questions or comments about the material, please raise an issue or contact me directly.

It is organised into the following sections

## Business Justifications ##

Business justifications are submitted to the ISO 20022 Payments SEG to explain why a particular change, or set of changes, is needed. It explains the business background to the proposed change, but does not include any technical recommendations as to the best method of achieving the desired results.

If a Business Justification requires new messages, then it must be approved by the ISO 20022 Registration Management Group as well as the Payments SEG.

## Change Requests ##

Change requests are submitted to the ISO 20022 Payments SEG to propose a particular change to one (or sometimes more) existing message(s). They are reviewed and approved by the Payments SEG.

## Explanatory Material ##

The Mojaloop Foundation produces additional material from time to time to support its proposals. These items can be found here.
