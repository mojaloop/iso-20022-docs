#### Context
*(DFSP -> FXP, FXP -> DFSP, HUB -> DFSP, HUB -> FXP)*

This is triggered as a callback response to the POST /fxQuotes call when an error occurs. The message is generated by the entity who first encounter the error which can either be the DFSP, the HUB, or the FPX. All other participants involved are informed by this message. The `TxInfAndSts.StsRsnInf.Rsn.Cd` contains the Mojaloop error code, which specified the source and cause of the error.

Here is an example of the message:
```json
{
"GrpHdr": {
    "MsgId":"01JBVM1CGC5A18XQVYYRF68FD1",
    "CreDtTm":"2024-11-04T12:57:45.228Z"},
"TxInfAndSts":{"StsRsnInf":{"Rsn": {"Cd":"ErrorCode"}}}
}

#### Header Details 
The API message header should contain the following details. Required headers are specified with an `*` asterisks.

| Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Description |
|--|--|
|**Content-Length**<br>*integer*<br>(header)|The `Content-Length` header field indicates the anticipated size of the payload body. Only sent if there is a body.**Note:** The API supports a maximum size of 5242880 bytes (5 Megabytes).|
| * **Type**<br>*string*<br>(path)|The type of the party identifier. For example, `MSISDN`, `PERSONAL_ID`.|
| * **ID**<br>*string*<br>(path)| The identifier value.|
| * **Content-Type** <br>*string*<br>(header)|The `Content-Type` header indicates the specific version of the API used to send the payload body.|
| * **Date**<br>*string*<br>(header)|The `Date` header field indicates the date when the request was sent.|
| **X-Forwarded-For** <br> *string*<br>(header)|The `X-Forwarded-For` header field is an unofficially accepted standard used for informational purposes of the originating client IP address, as a request might pass multiple proxies, firewalls, and so on. Multiple `X-Forwarded-For` values should be expected and supported by implementers of the API.**Note:** An alternative to `X-Forwarded-For` is defined in [RFC 7239](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239). However, to this point RFC 7239 is less-used and supported than `X-Forwarded-For`.|
| * **FSPIOP-Source** <br> *string*<br>(header)|The `FSPIOP-Source` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the API for identifying the sender of the HTTP request. The field should be set by the original sender of the request. Required for routing and signature verification (see header field `FSPIOP-Signature`).|
| **FSPIOP-Destination** <br> *string*<br>(header)|The `FSPIOP-Destination` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the API for HTTP header based routing of requests and responses to the destination. The field must be set by the original sender of the request if the destination is known (valid for all services except GET /parties) so that any entities between the client and the server do not need to parse the payload for routing purposes. If the destination is not known (valid for service GET /parties), the field should be left empty.|
| **FSPIOP-Encryption** <br> *string*<br>(header) | The `FSPIOP-Encryption` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the API for applying end-to-end encryption of the request.|
| **FSPIOP-Signature** <br> *string* <br> (header)| The `FSPIOP-Signature` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the API for applying an end-to-end request signature.|
| **FSPIOP-URI** <br> *string* <br> (header) | The `FSPIOP-URI` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the API for signature verification, should contain the service URI. Required if signature verification is used, for more information, see [the API Signature document](https://github.com/mojaloop/docs/tree/main/Specification%20Document%20Set).|
| **FSPIOP-HTTP-Method** <br> *string* <br> (header) | The `FSPIOP-HTTP-Method` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the API for signature verification, should contain the service HTTP method. Required if signature verification is used, for more information, see [the API Signature document](https://github.com/mojaloop/docs/tree/main/Specification%20Document%20Set).|
